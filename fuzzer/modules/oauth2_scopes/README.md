# API Module OAuth2 Scopes
This modules fuzzes OpenAPI endpoints, and ensures that OAuth2 scopes are implemented correctly.
Given a list of client ids and secrets with their associated scopes, this module will request the provided 
authorization server for an access token using client credentials flow, then check each endpoint.
There are two criterias for failure:

1. An endpoint does not grant access to a user with the required scopes
2. An endpoint grants access to a user with some or none of the required scopes

# Operation
First, a dependency tree for calls are generated using RESTler
From there, there are two operating modes: exhaustive and non-exhaustive

## Non-Exhaustive
In non-exhaustive mode, for each client, the dependency tree is executed twice.
The first time, a token is generated without any scopes. The second time, the token
is generated by requesting all the scopes a client has.

## Exhaustive
In exhaustive mode, for each client, every combination of scopes is generated. 
Then the dependency tree is executed for each combination.

:WARNING: This mode will increase runtime exponentially.
For example, if a client has n scopes, the total number of combinations generated will be
nCn-1 + nCn-2 + ... nC1 = n^2 by the binomial theorem. This is for a single client.
